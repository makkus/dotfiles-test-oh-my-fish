      # - fish -> we don't need to specify this here, as freckelize just uses the 'fish' folder name anyay

# 'ansible-tasks' adapter doesn't really need to be here,
# but next version of freckelize will support 'auto-detection' of profiles
# which means instead of executing:
# freckelize -f gh:makkus/dotfiles dotfiles ansible=tasks
# this will be enough (if the adapters are specified in .freckle:
# freckelize -f gh:makkus/dotfiles
- ansible-tasks

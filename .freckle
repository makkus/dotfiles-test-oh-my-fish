# 'ansible-tasks' adapter doesn't really need to be here,
# but next version of freckelize will support 'auto-detection' of profiles
# which means instead of executing:
#
#    freckelize -f gh:makkus/dotfiles dotfiles ansible=tasks
#
# this will be enough (if the adapters are specified in .freckle:
#
#    freckelize -f gh:makkus/dotfiles
